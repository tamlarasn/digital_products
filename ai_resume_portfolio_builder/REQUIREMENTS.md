# Commercial Product Requirements: AI-Powered Resume & Portfolio Builder

---

## 0. Principles & Dispute Avoidance

- **Clarity:** All features and deliverables are described as specifically as possible. If ambiguity arises, the product owner’s interpretation prevails unless both sides agree to clarify via written change.
- **Change Management:** Any requirements change, feature addition/removal, or scope adjustment must be made in writing and agreed by both parties. This file is the single source of truth.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** A feature is considered complete when it meets the exact requirements described here, passes mutually agreed user tests, and is free of critical bugs.
- **Communication:** All questions, clarifications, or disputes must be addressed in writing before implementation. If a requirement is unclear, pause implementation and request clarification.
- **Licensing/Compliance:** All third-party/open-source components must be commercial-use licensed (MIT, Apache, etc.), with clear attribution if required.
